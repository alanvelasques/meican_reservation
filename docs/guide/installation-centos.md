## INSTALLATION GUIDE - CentOS

Follow the steps detailed below.

This configuration was tested and performed on CentOS 6.7.

#### 1. Prepare environment

#### 1.1. Update Yum repository
```
yum update
rpm -Uvh https://mirror.webtatic.com/yum/el6/latest.rpm
```
#### 1.2. Install Apache
```
yum install httpd
```

#### 1.3. Install MySQL
```
yum install mysql-server
```

#### 1.4. Install cURL
```
yum install curl
```

#### 1.5. Install PHP 5.5

```
yum install php55w php55w-mysql php55w-curl php55w-soap php55w-xml php55w-mbstring
```

There may be a conflict between the native PHP CentOS and the version that the Meican requires. To remove the native version, run:

```
yum remove php-common
```

After that, runs the install command again.

#### 1.6. Start Apache and MySQL

Turn on all required services: 

````
chkconfig mysqld on
service mysqld start
chkconfig httpd on
service httpd start
````

#### 1.7. Install and start OSCARS Bridge

If you want use the Monitoring module, is required an OSCARS Bridge instance. It is not necessary that this instance is on the same machine as the MEICAN. See [this document](https://github.com/ufrgs-hyman/oscars-bridge/blob/master/README.md) for installation instructions. 

Later, in the configuration step, you must provide the OSCARS Bridge URL if you want use the Monitoring module.

#### 1.8. Esmond

The Monitoring module requires an Esmond instance. It is recommended that this instance is located in a **secondary** machine for performance issues. The installation and configuration of the Esmond is not in the scope of this guide. See the [official repository](https://github.com/esnet/esmond) for more information.

Later, in the configuration step, you must provide the Esmond API URL if you want use the Monitoring module.

#### 1.9. Firewall configuration

In the RNP environment, the server is protected by an outer firewall and its rules are controlled at a higher level. The firewall of the operating system level is not required for this environment, but it can be to another. To disable the firewall perform the following:

```
service iptables save
service iptables stop
chkconfig iptables off
```

#### 1.10. SELinux configuration

MEICAN requires the SELinux disabled or in permissive mode. To enable the permissive mode execute:

```
setenforce 0
```

#### 2. Setup database

If this is an **upgrade**, you don't need create a database. Go to step 3.

The fastest method to do this is via command line:

```
mysql -u #user# -p
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `meican`;
```

#### 3. Download and install MEICAN

#### 3.1. Download

In a public folder (e.g. /var/www) [download a stable version](https://github.com/ufrgs-hyman/meican/releases):

```
wget https://github.com/ufrgs-hyman/meican/archive/#version#.tar.gz
tar -zxvf #version#.tar.gz
```

#### 3.2. Configure database settings

**Warning**: If this is an **upgrade**, you must keep the old settings and the new installation will be upgrade the database keeping the data. Look the older db.php file and copy the database name and credentials.

```
nano #meican-folder#/config/db.php
```

#### 3.3. Install Composer

On source code folder (#meican-folder#) install the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

```
curl -O https://getcomposer.org/download/1.2.0/composer.phar
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.2.1"
```

#### 3.4. Install MEICAN

Install MEICAN and all dependencies. It is **possible** that before the installation you are prompted by a "access token" of GitHub. You must have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to request a valid token. 

In the meican folder run:

```
php composer.phar install
```

#### 4. Check permissions

Make sure the Apache/PHP has full permission in the MEICAN runtime folders. In the meican folder runs:
```
chmod -R 775 runtime/
chmod -R 775 web/assets/
chown -R apache:apache runtime/
chown -R apache:apache web/assets/
```

#### 5. Apache configuration

Create a simbolic link to app web folder on /var/www:

```
sudo ln -s /path/to/#meican-folder#/web /var/www/meican
```

By default, the Rewrite mode is enabled on CentOS 6.7. To confirm this, verify that the following line is uncommented:

```
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
```

Enable symbolic links and change the document root:

```
DocumentRoot /var/www/meican

<Directory /var/www>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
</Directory>
```

Finally restart the Apache service:

```
service httpd restart
```

After that, MEICAN will be available at localhost with one user created:

```
user: master
pass: master
```

If you are doing a upgrade, go back to [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/ufrgs-hyman/meican/blob/master/docs/guide/upgrade.md). If this is not your case, next step is set parameters and configure the app. Look the [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/ufrgs-hyman/meican/blob/master/docs/guide/configuration.md).
